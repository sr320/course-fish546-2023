# SNPs in RNA-seq data

Finding SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) in RNA-seq data is an essential step in understanding genetic variation and its effects on gene expression. Here is a summary of the process:

1.  Quality control and preprocessing: Start by assessing the quality of your raw RNA-seq reads using tools like FastQC. Trim low-quality bases and adapter sequences using software like Trimmomatic or Cutadapt to ensure accurate downstream analysis.

2.  Alignment: Align the cleaned RNA-seq reads to a reference genome using a spliced aligner like STAR, HISAT2, or TopHat2. These tools can handle the intron-exon structure of RNA-seq data and provide accurate alignments.

3.  Sort and index alignments: Use SAMtools or Picard to convert the alignment output (SAM) to a binary format (BAM), sort, and index the aligned reads for efficient data processing.

4.  Variant calling: Employ a variant caller such as GATK's HaplotypeCaller, SAMtools mpileup, or FreeBayes to identify SNPs and other genetic variants in your RNA-seq data. These tools use statistical models to call SNPs based on the differences observed between aligned reads and the reference genome.

5.  Filtering: Apply quality filters to remove low-confidence variant calls. Use tools like GATK's VariantFiltration or BCFtools filter to set quality thresholds based on parameters like depth, quality score, strand bias, and mapping quality.

6.  Annotation: Annotate the filtered SNPs using software like ANNOVAR, SnpEff, or VEP to gain insights into their potential functional effects on genes, transcripts, and proteins.

7.  Downstream analysis: Investigate the potential impact of SNPs on gene expression, alternative splicing, or allele-specific expression using tools like DESeq2, edgeR, or Cufflinks.

Remember that this is only a general summary and specific steps might vary depending on the organism, reference genome, and experimental conditions. Always consult the documentation of the chosen tools and follow best practices for RNA-seq data analysis.
